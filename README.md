> **POSVault** is a decentralized treasury vault and DAO governance protocol built on Stacks (Bitcoin L2). Deposit STX to earn POS-GOV governance tokens, then use those tokens to shape the protocol's future through on-chain voting.

## 🏗️ Architecture

POSVault consists of **3 smart contracts** and a **React frontend**:

```

│   ├── governance-token.clar    # SIP-010 POS-GOV fungible token
│   ├── vault-core.clar          # STX treasury vault with yield
│   └── proposal-voting.clar     # DAO governance & voting
├── frontend/
│   └── src/
│       ├── App.jsx              # Main React application
│       ├── stacks.js            # @stacks/connect & @stacks/transactions integration
│       ├── index.css            # Design system
│       └── main.jsx             # Entry point
├── tests/
│   ├── governance-token.test.ts # Token tests (11 tests)
│   ├── vault-core.test.ts       # Vault tests (13 tests)
│   └── proposal-voting.test.ts  # Governance tests (9 tests)
└── Clarinet.toml                # Project configuration
```

## 📜 Smart Contracts

### 1. `governance-token.clar` — POS-GOV Token (SIP-010)

The governance token implementing the SIP-010 fungible token standard.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Name | POSVault Governance Token |
| Symbol | POS-GOV |
| Decimals | 6 |
| Max Supply | 1,000,000,000 POS-GOV |

**Key Functions:**
- `mint` — Mint new POS-GOV tokens (owner/authorized minters only)
- `burn` — Burn POS-GOV tokens
- `transfer` — Transfer POS-GOV tokens (SIP-010)
- `add-minter` / `remove-minter` — Manage authorized minters
- `toggle-minting` — Enable/disable minting

### 2. `vault-core.clar` — STX Treasury Vault

The core vault that accepts STX deposits and distributes POS-GOV yield rewards.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Reward Rate | 100 basis points per cycle (configurable) |
| Reward Cycle | ~144 blocks (~1 day) |
| Reward Token | POS-GOV |

**Key Functions:**
- `deposit` — Deposit STX (transfers to contract address)
- `withdraw` — Withdraw all deposited STX + pending rewards
- `claim-rewards` — Claim POS-GOV rewards without withdrawing
- `set-reward-rate` — Set reward rate (admin/owner)
- `toggle-pause` — Pause/unpause vault (admin/owner)
- `emergency-withdraw` — Emergency withdrawal (owner only)
- `add-admin` / `remove-admin` — Authorize admin contracts

### 3. `proposal-voting.clar` — DAO Governance

DAO proposal and voting system for protocol governance.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Voting Period | ~1,008 blocks (~7 days) |
| Min Proposal Tokens | 1 POS-GOV |
| Quorum | 10% of total supply |

**Key Functions:**
- `create-proposal` — Create a governance proposal
- `vote` — Vote on a proposal (weighted by POS-GOV balance)
- `execute-proposal` — Execute a passed proposal
- Supports proposal types: `general`, `reward-rate`, `pause`

## 🖥️ Frontend

The frontend is built with **React + Vite** and integrates with Stacks using:

- **`@stacks/connect`** — Wallet connection (Hiro Wallet, Leather)
- **`@stacks/transactions`** — Contract calls, read-only queries, post-conditions
- **`@stacks/network`** — Network configuration (testnet/mainnet)

### Features
- 🔐 **Vault Tab** — Deposit STX, withdraw, claim POS-GOV rewards
- 🗳️ **Governance Tab** — Create proposals, vote, execute
- 📊 **Portfolio Tab** — View wallet stats, protocol info
- ⚡ **Wallet Connect** — One-click wallet connection
- 🎨 **Premium UI** — Dark theme with glassmorphism, gradients, and micro-animations
